    <p>
        This website is the complementary online tool to our paper "SoK: On the offensive potential of AI."  It includes a list of academic papers (technical and non-technical) and InfoSec briefings (from BlackHat and DefCon), scrutinized based on the offensive AI checklist we developed in our paper. 
        The checklist is a lifelong classification of the key-factors of technologies related to offensive AI, allowing us to objectively examine and compare existing and novel use-cases of offensive AI according to a clearly defined set of criteria. Further details will be provided after the paper has been published.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below, we provide three lists: (i) for the technical papers, (ii) for the non-technical papers, and (iii) for the InfoSec briefings. The key difference between technical and non-technical papers is that technical papers must demonstrate a practical implementation of the AI model.
