Welcome to the repository of our Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper about the offensive potential of AI.

This repository provides a list of academic papers and InfoSec briefings about offensive AI. Each paper has been scrutinized based on the Offensive AI checklist which we developed in our paper "SoK: On the Offensive Potential of AI."

If you spot any mistakes, or missing papers, feel free to contact us (anonymous for now, but we will add credentials after having published the paper).
